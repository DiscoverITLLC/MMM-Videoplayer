### CSS Tricks

If you want to change the size of the player. Add the following in your custom.css and set the size there.

````css
.MMM-Videoplayer video {
    width: 560px;
    height: 315px;
}
````

If you want to rotate the player 90 degrees and set the size:

````CSS
.MMM-Videoplayer video {
    width: 560px;
    height: 315px;
    -moz-transform:rotate(90deg);
    -webkit-transform:rotate(90deg);
    -o-transform:rotate(90deg);
    -ms-transform:rotate(90deg);
    transform:rotate(90deg);
}
````

Normally you just need to add the line:

````CSS
    transform:rotate(90deg);
````

But for comparability reasons, you can add all of them. üôÇ

And, as you will probably notice with the above CSS code. If you set the size as your screen size, the video player will not really ‚Äúfill‚Äù the whole screen (if you put in in the "fullscreen_below" region) when you turn it 90 degrees. So, then you need to do this:

````CSS
.MMM-Videoplayer video {
    position: absolute;
    transform:rotate(90deg);
    transform-origin: bottom left;
    width: 100vh;
    height: 100vw;
    margin-top: -100vw;
    object-fit: cover;
}
````

### Notes
Even if the player is hidden, you can start and stop the video by sending "notifications" to it. :)
